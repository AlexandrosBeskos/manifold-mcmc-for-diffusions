# Manifold MCMC for diffusions

Code accompanying the paper [*Manifold MCMC methods for Bayesian inference in a wide class of diffusion models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02982).

For a complete example of applying the method described in the paper to perform inference in a Fitzhugh-Nagumo hypoelliptic diffusion model see the Jupyter notebook [00_Example_with_FitzHugh-Nagumo]
